1.  Introduction:
Our client would like an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.   They want the program to generate
a strong password that meets certain criteria to provde greater security. When a user clicks on a button to generate a password, they are presented with a series of prompts to select (1) 
length of the password which must be between 8 and 128 characters, and (2) if they want to include upper case, lower case, numeric and special characters.  When all proper inputs are validated, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.  The password is then either displaye in an alert or written to the page.
